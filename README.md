# NonogramProject

Nonogram Project (Unity 2020)

### Next steps:

- Check if rightclick for "cross" is possible

- Provide solution
- Check if solved
- Load encoded numbers on the side to given solution

- QoL: Holding mouse cannot change colour twice **_DONE? You can't change colour back now, but you can swap both colours at the same time.. dunno if that's what we want. Might need to overhaul whole code otherwise (which might be good lol)_**
